    "     Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that \"learn\" â€“ that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.\n",
    "     Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n",
